## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, }
## Cmd + Alt + I
knitr::kable(
      mtcars[1:5, ],
      caption = "A knitr kable."
)

```

```{r}
mtcars[1:5,]
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
 best_in_class <- mpg %>%
      group_by(class) %>%
      filter(row_number(desc(hwy)) == 1)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
      geom_point(size = 3, shape = 1, data = best_in_class) +
      geom_label_repel(
        aes(label = model),
        data = best_in_class
      )

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
